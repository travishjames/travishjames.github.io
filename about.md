I am a data scientist who is passionate about solving problems and extracting insights from data. I believe that data can be used as a strategic asset in any context, and am excited about pursuing projects that allow me to blend my economics background with the data science tool belt. Big or small, for back end analysis or front end interactivity, I am ready and eager to tackle any data-related problem that comes my way.
